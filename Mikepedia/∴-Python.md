# ∴ Python  
The first time I used **Python** ~2013 when I created some **Jython** scripts that would read configuration from source control and apply it to a WebSphere deployment target. Thankfully, the days of **Jython** and the aforementioned Java application server are *long* behind me.  
  
Since those fateful days, I've dabbled with **Python** and **LXML** here and there. Now days, I'm working on a Django backend. What you'll find here are some public notes and curated resources  that I've accumulated as I'm getting to know **Python** and **Django** better.  
  
## Django  
The [Django Project Creation Guide](./Django-Project-Creation-Guide.md) helps me remember how to spin up new Django projects locally. I've recently started using [Django REST Framework](../Django%20REST%20Framework.md) to expose Django views as an API.  
  
## Curated Resources  
[Django News](https://django-news.com/) is a weekly newsletter that includes helpful links and updates relevant to the Django community.  
  
[Brett Cannon](https://snarky.ca/) blogs about Python tools and internals. [Will Vincent](https://wsvincent.com/) has a book for Django beginners and blogs as well. [Carlton Gibson](https://noumenal.es/) hosts the [Django Chat](https://djangochat.com/) podcast and blogs occasionally. [Adam Johnson](https://adamj.eu/) is an open source maintainer who writes books and blogs with a focus on Django.
