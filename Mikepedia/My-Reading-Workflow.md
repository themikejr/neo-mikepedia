# My Reading Workflow  
*a lightweight process for developing ideas*  
  
When it comes to **PKM** and **TAKING NOTES**, having a solid reading workflow is important. The strong desire for [Collecting Information](./Collecting-Information.md) is often a trap which breeds to complex workflows that sound cool but don't add value. This reading and note-taking workflow is lightweight but has room to expand when it's worth it. There are three steps in the workflow, each with their own note type.   
  
This workflow is not an invention out of thin air. It's a result of [Combinational Creativity](../Combinational%20Creativity.md). It definite similarities to other note-taking systems, even the old-school way that the man himself --- Niklas Luhmann --- took notes.   
  
The **reading workflow** starts with the **Hub Note**. If the needed it progresses to the **Highlight Note** and finally, **Main Note**.  
  
## 1: The Hub Note  
The idea with the **Hub Note** is the lightweight place to record thoughts that occur while consuming a source. When a thought occurs while reading, record the page number and a word, phrase, or sentence that describes the thought. Here is an example:  
  
```markdown  
# The Spirit of Early Christian Thought  
2003, Robert Louis Wilken  
  
108 seek his face always  
153 our mind is beyond us  
173 student begins by putting himself in hands of teacher  
```  
  
The page number is an anchor linking back to the source itself. Highlighting or other marks in the source might assist recall. The note next to the page number is written with intention. Ideally, it is in your own words. It can be a direct quotation, but there is value in the thinking needed to express yourself. This is one way into [active thinking](./active-thinking.md).  
  
I first got this idea from [Bob Doto](https://writing.bobdoto.computer/what-is-a-literature-note/). He calls this the **Reference Note**. [Scott Scheper]() calls it the **Bibnote**. Scheper would say this is basically what Luhmann (I believe him). Depending on where/how one reads, it may be worth starting with an analog version of the hub note. Tuck an index card in your book and use it to track these thoughts as you read. Old school approaches like these allow one to disconnect from the digital world.  
  
## 2: The Highlight Note  
The **Highlight Note** is the next step in developing the thought. If one of the lines in the **Hub Note** continues to resonate, turn that text into a note who's filename is the noted phrase itself. For example, here is a case where I decided to further reflect on *seek his face always*, so I link to a **Highlight Note** in my **Hub Note** (`[...]` denotes linked text):  
  
```markdown  
# The Spirit of Early Christian Thought  
2003, Robert Louis Wilken  
  
108 [seek his face always]  
153 our mind is beyond us  
173 student begins by putting himself in hands of teacher  
```  
  
In the **highlight note**, create a dated section and commit to reflecting on the passage for a few minutes. Very often, new connections, ideas, and notes are born here. An example **Highlight Note**:  
  
```markdown  
up:: [The Spirit of Early Christian Thought]  
# Seek His Face Always  
  
> As we grow in understanding, says Augustine, we think   
> we will reach an end in our search. But the psalmist   
> says "seek his face _always."_ David is not speaking   
> about knowing God as we know other things...

We usually want to know so that we can arrive at some   
sort of certainty and move on. But knowing isn't so simple  
with God or other things. As soon as we think we "find"   
understanding, the seeking begins again because we've   
learned about things we weren't aware of before. Finding   
is an invitation for more seeking.  
  
This reminds me of <<1 Cor 8:2>> where Paul says  "If anyone   
imagines that he knows something, he does not yet know as   
he ought to know".   
  
New note ideas:  
  
- [find as though you will go on seeking]  
- ...  
```  
  
I became convinced of the value of an exercise like this when [Bianca Pereira](https://biancapereira.me/) led us in a 6 minute freewriting exercise during the [Linking Your Thinking](https://linkingyourthinking.com) workshop. In 6 minutes I had deeper ideas about the topic at hand than I ever expected to have. If a note in your hub note is worth reflecting on, take 5 minutes or so and freewrite. You probably won't regret it.   
  
## 3: The Main Note  
The freewriting exercise will often lead to ideas that that are worth storing in a **Main Note**. These notes are canonical ones that store a single idea, concept, person, or statement. The **Main Note** is the pure thought-stuff of a PKM system. These notes can grow over time, get connected to other notes in exciting ways, and often breed new notes. An example:  
  
```markdown  
up :: [Concepts]  
  
# Find as though you will go on seeking  
  
In the pursuit of knowledge, skill, achievenment, and   
happiness, it is important tothink of *finding* (or  
achieving, acquiring) as the next step in the journey.  
Finding something is less like an arrival at certainty   
or landing on some sort of final achievement. Instead,   
*finding* is but one step in a process of continual   
seeking. Indeed, *finding* opens new doors to things   
we did not know before.  
  
This is similar to [how dopamine works]. It is also   
a mindset that can help us to [remain open] as   
we become wiser.   
```  
  
There are many approaches to actually writing the **Main Note**. The example above is not the one true way. The "right" way to do it is a topic of debate amongst the PKM geeks. I certainly didn't come up with the idea of atomic notes myself. [Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes) calls them **Evergreen Notes**. [Sonke Ahrens](https://twitter.com/soenke_ahrens?lang=en) calls them **Permanent Notes**. [Nick Milo](https://twitter.com/NickMilo) calls them **Thing** and **Statement** notes.
