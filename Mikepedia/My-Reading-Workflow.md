# My Reading Workflow  
  
When it comes to **PKM** and **TAKING NOTES**, having a solid reading workflow is important. For those with a strong desire for [Collecting Information](./Collecting-Information.md) (as I have) it's easy to design a note-taking workflow for reading that is too complex or cumbersome. Often, a complex workflow sounds good in our minds, but in reality we lack the time and patience to use it. I've landed on a reading + note-taking workflow in my **PKM** system that is very lightweight but at the same time as room to expand as much as one wants to interact with the source material. The **Reading Workflow** consists of 3 value-add steps or note types. I won't claim that I've invented this workflow myself. It is very similar to aspects of other approaches to **PKM**. It may not even be that different from Luhmann's own reading workflow. I take this as a good sign! Newer and shinier is not better. The three value-add note types are **The Hubnote**, **The Highlight Note**, and **The Main Note**.  
  
## 1: The Hub Note  
The idea with the **Hub Note** is to give yourself a very lightweight place to record thoughts that occur while you are consuming a source. A source could be an article, book, or essay. This could also be expanded for other media like film. In any case, all you have to do when you have a thought while reading is write down the page note, and a word, phrase, or sentence that describes the thought you had. Here is an example:  
  
```  
# The Spirit of Early Christian Thought  
2003, Robert Louis Wilken  
  
108 seek his face always  
153 our mind is beyond us  
173 the student begins by putting himself in the hands of the teacher  
```  
  
The page number gives you a spot to go back to. If you wish to highlight in the actual book that may help with recall. The text next to the page number is intentionally written. Ideally, it is a phrase written in your words that evokes what prompted you to note this passage. It can be a direct quotation, but there is value summarizing it in your own words. This is an initial avenue toward [active thinking](./active-thinking.md).  
  
I first got this idea from [Bob Doto](https://writing.bobdoto.computer/what-is-a-literature-note/). He calls this the **Reference Note**. [Scott Scheper]() calls this the **Bibnote**. As Scheper notes, this is basically what Luhmann did while he read. In fact, depending on where you are reading, you might want to start with an analog version of the hub note by tucking an index card in your book and using it to track these thoughts as you read. An approach like this is truly old school and lets you disconnect from the digital world.  
  
## 2: The Highlight Note  
The **Highlight Note** is the next step in developing your thinking. If one of the lines that you created in your **Hub Note** continues to resonate, turn that text into a note who's filename is the noted phrase itself. For example, I've decided to further reflect on *seek his face always*, so I link to a **Highlight Note** in my **Hub Note**:  
  
```  
# The Spirit of Early Christian Thought  
2003, Robert Louis Wilken  
  
108 [seek his face always](seek%20his%20face%20always.md)  
153 our mind is beyond us  
173 the student begins by putting himself in the hands of the teacher  
```  
  
In the highlight note, create a dated section and commit to reflecting on the passage for a few minutes. Very often, new connections, ideas, and notes are born here. An example **Highlight Note** looks like this:

We usually want to know so that we can arrive at some sort of certainty and move on.  
But knowing isn't so simple with God or other things. As soon as we think we "find"  
understanding, the seeking begins again because we've learned about things we weren't  
aware of before. Finding is an invitation for more seeking.  
  
This reminds me of my note on [1 Cor 8:2](1%20Cor%208:2.md) where Paul says "If anyone imagines that he knows something, he does not yet know as he ought to know".   
  
New note ideas:  
  
- [find as though you will go on seeking](find%20as%20though%20you%20will%20go%20on%20seeking.md)  
- ...  
````  
  
I became convinced of the value of an exercise like this when [Bianca Pereira](https://biancapereira.me/) led us in a 6 minute freewriting exercise during the [Linking Your Thinking](https://linkingyourthinking.com) workshop. In 6 minutes I had deeper ideas about the topic at hand than I ever expected to have. If a note in your hub note is worth reflecting on, take 5 minutes or so and freewrite. You probably won't regret it.   
  
## 3: The Main Note  
The freewriting exercise will often lead to ideas that will lead you to create a **Main Note**. A main note is a canonical note that relates to a single idea, like a concept, person, or statement of some sort. The **Main Note** is the pure thought-stuff of your PKM system. These notes can grow over time, get connected to other notes in exciting ways, and often breed new notes. An example:  
  
```  
up :: [Concepts](Concepts.md)  
  
# Find as though you will go on seeking  
  
In the pursuit of knowledge, skill, achievenment, and happiness, it is important to  
think of *finding* (or achieving, acquiring) as the next step in the journey.  
Finding something is less like an arrival at certainty or landing on some sort of   
final achievement. Instead, *finding* is but one step in a process of continual seeking.  
Indeed, *finding* opens new doors to things we did not know before.  
  
This is similar to [how dopamine works](how%20dopamine%20works.md). It is also a mindset that can help us to [remain open](remain%20open.md) as we become wiser.   
```  
  
There are many approaches to actually writing the **Main Note** so don't take my example above as the one true way. The "right" way to do it is a topic of debat amongst PKM geeks. I certainly didn't come up with the idea of atomic notes myself. [Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes) calls them **Evergreen Notes**. [Sonke Ahrens](https://twitter.com/soenke_ahrens?lang=en) calls them **Permanent Notes**. [Nick Milo](https://twitter.com/NickMilo) calls them **Thing** and **Statement** notes.
