# Placeholder Note  
A **Placeholder** note can serve many purposes. Ultimately, it lays claim to digital space on behalf of an idea, concept, or tool that needs to be explored further. Once digital land has been claimed for this idea it can live in you **Personal Knowledge Management** system. You can choose to develop it when you have time. Until then, it lives on.  
  
Perhaps, like me, you've discovered and forgotten more helpful ideas on Twitter you might care to admit. A workflow that involves placeholder notes captures *just* enough information so that you can dive in later without adding burdensome capture steps.   
  
For example, say I come across an interesting tweet which suggest that building an API is very good first step to take when developing a product in the face of uncertainty. A placeholder note might look like:  
  
```markdown  
tags :: #note/develop   
  
# API-first   
*this note needs work*

```  
  
If you have an extra minute, record why this seems like something worth exploring to give your future-self some context:  
  
```markdown  
tags :: #note/develop   
  
# API-first   
*this note needs work*  
  
(Beginning with building an API for that saturn   
project might have avoided many of the issues we   
faced getting started.)

```  
  
This is merely an Make the shape of the note your own. Find a format that works for you.  
  
A good **Placeholder** note should have:  
  
1. something that designates it for further development later.  
2. a title that captures the idea.  
3. reference links so you can quickly jump into developing it if you decide to do so.
