# Syllable Counting
Tracking syllables is important for understanding and applying accent rules. In Greek, the syllables are counted from the end of the word. The last three syllables are given names: Ultima, Penultima, Antepenultima:

```
ὀ-λι-γό-πι-στος
     (3)(2)(1)
```

1. Ultima
2. Penultima
3. Antepenultima

Accents can only occur on one of these named syllables.

When the final syllable of a word has a short vowel the accent can go as far back as the antepenultima. When the final syllable of a word has a long vowel, the accent can go as far back as the penultima.

# Accent Types
Some words do not have accents. The accent on a "proclitic" is counted with the next word. The accent on an "enclitic" is counted on the previous word. Proclitics do not have accents. Enclitics may have accents. Rules for enclitics are complex.

## Acute: ά 

## Grave: ὰ
Can only appear on the *ultima* or last syllable.

## Circumflex: ᾶ
Restricted in where it can appear in a word. Can only appear in the last or second to last syllable. Depending on the font, may look like the example above or more like a tilde. 

# Nouns vs. Verbs
Verbs and nouns have different systems for accenting.

## Nouns
Need to memorize the default accent location for each word.

## Verbs
Accent is close to the beginning of the word as possible, up to the antepenultima. This is called being "recessive". They are usually accented on the second to last syllable of the word.

Rules:
- *with short final vowel* - the accent may reach the antepenultima syllable
- *with long final vowel* - the accent may reach the penultima syllable
