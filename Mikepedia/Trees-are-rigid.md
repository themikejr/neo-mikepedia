# Trees are rigid  
  
One common criticism of using a [Tree](./Tree.md) to organize information is that **trees** tend to be inflexible. One has to dedicate some amount of thought to determine a meaningful hierarchal structure so that everything has a the right "place" to live. In a hierarchal structure like a tree, *proximity* is used as a way to communicate meaning and relationship.  
  
When adding information to a hierarchal structure, one has to ask "where should this go?" early on. This elicits a [Top-down Thinking](../Top-down%20Thinking.md)  style where the structure has to be known before the data is populated or content is created. If the structure changes, the new structure has to be premediated and then data has to be reorganized. This problem is seen in areas beyond just organizing files in a folder hierarchy.  
  
In organizations, **trees** are used to to describe the structure of people and projects. This can lead to problems. Sometimes, a team, person, or project in one section of the tree needs to interact with another member of the tree that has a different parent. In some organizations communicating with other parts of the tree has administrative overhead. Successful organizations seem to be able to correctly ignore their hierarchal structures and communicate across them. Tim Berners-Lee observed this at CERN:  
  
> CERN is a wonderful organisation. It involves several thousand people, many of them very creative, all working toward common goals. Although they are nominally organised into a hierarchical management structure, this does not constrain the way people will communicate, and share information, equipment and software across groups.      
>   
> The actual observed working structure of the organisation is a multiply connected "web" whose interconnections evolve with time. In this environment, a new person arriving, or someone taking on a new task, is normally given a few hints as to who would be useful people to talk to. Information about what facilities exist and how to find out about them travels in the corridor gossip and occasional newsletters, and the details about what is required to be done spread in a similar way. All things considered, the result is remarkably successful, despite occasional misunderstandings and duplicated effort.
