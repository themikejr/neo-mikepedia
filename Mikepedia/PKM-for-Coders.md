# PKM for Coders  
*This public note is a work in progress. I'm eager to build more concrete examples of PKM strategies and techniques for those who those who code. To contribute helpful feedback, please **[contact](https://mikebrinker.net/contact/)** me or leave a comment below.*  
  
Despite **Software Engineer** being the classic example of a Knowledge Worker, very seldom do the popular PKM methods, techniques, and courses focus on use-cases for coders. This note covers some approaches that I've found useful.   
  
## Strategy  
As much as anyone, software developers, data engineers, site reliability engineers, and sysadmins are at risk of falling for the [Collector's Fallacy](./Collector's-Fallacy.md) when it comes to using a **Personal Knowledge Management** system. We will always gravitate to merely [Collecting Information](./Collecting-Information.md). Instead, our systems for managing knowledge should lean towards aiding the *development* of knowledge. Developing knowledge is the harder part --- it's the actual work.   
  
1. Producing Information *leads to* [Developing Knowledge](./Developing-Knowledge.md).  
2. [Learn in order to teach](Learn%20in%20order%20to%20teach.md).  
3. Seek opportunities for [Sharing Knowledge](./Sharing-Knowledge.md).  
4. Capture to assist recall in the short term.  
  
## Tactics  
These are the moves to make in your system in order to develop your knowledge. The art of managing and developing knowledge is rooted in choosing the right tactic at the right time.  
  
1. The [Curiosity List](./Curiosity-List.md) inspires and guides your learning.   
2. The [Guide Note](./Guide-Note.md) is a playbook and memory cache.  
3. The [Placeholder Note](./Placeholder-Note.md) is a bookmark for later exploration.  
4. The Resource List contains greatest hits for important subjects.
