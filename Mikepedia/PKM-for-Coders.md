# PKM for Coders  
Despite **Software Engineer** being the classic example of a Knowledge Worker, very seldom do the popular PKM methods, techniques, and courses focus on use-cases for coders. This note covers some approaches that I've found useful.   
  
## Strategy  
As much as anyone, software developers, data engineers, site reliability engineers, and sysadmins are at risk of falling for the [Collector's Fallacy](Collector's%20Fallacy.md) when it comes to using a **Personal Knowledge Management** system. I contend that our systems for managing knowledge should lean towards aiding *development* of the knowledge. Developing knowledge is that harder part. We naturally are always [Collecting Information](./Collecting-Information.md).  
  
1. Focus on [Developing Knowledge](./Developing-Knowledge.md).  
2. [Learn in order to teach](Learn%20in%20order%20to%20teach.md).  
3. Seek opportunities for [Sharing Knowledge](./Sharing-Knowledge.md).  
4. Capture to assist recall in the short term.  
  
  
## Tactics  
These tactics below are moves to make in your system in order to develop your knowledge. They assume the use of a note-taking tool that allows you to make links but they should be broadly applicable.  
  
1. Always keep a [Curiosity List](./Curiosity-List.md) where you can quickly add newly encountered terms, tools, and ideas.   
2. When learning a new tool, library, or framework, make a [Guide Note](./Guide-Note.md) for yourself.  
3. If you keep encountering articles, tweets, and links about something you want to learn more about later, create a [Placeholder Note](Placeholder%20Note.md).  
4. For things that you are working with in the long term, curate a [Resource List](Resource%20List.md).
