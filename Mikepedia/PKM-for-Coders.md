# PKM for Coders  
*This public note is a work in progress. I'm eager to build more concrete examples of PKM strategies and techniques for those who those who code. To contribute helpful feedback, please **[contact](https://mikebrinker.net/contact/)** me or leave a comment below.*  
  
Despite **Software Engineer** being the classic example of a Knowledge Worker, very seldom do the popular PKM methods, techniques, and courses focus on use-cases for coders. This note covers some approaches that I've found useful.   
  
## Strategy  
As much as anyone, software developers, data engineers, site reliability engineers, and sysadmins are at risk of falling for the [Collector's Fallacy](./Collector's-Fallacy.md) when it comes to using a **Personal Knowledge Management** system. I contend that our systems for managing knowledge should lean towards aiding *development* of the knowledge. Developing knowledge is that harder part. We naturally are always [Collecting Information](./Collecting-Information.md).  
  
1. Focus on [Developing Knowledge](./Developing-Knowledge.md).  
2. [Learn in order to teach](Learn%20in%20order%20to%20teach.md).  
3. Seek opportunities for [Sharing Knowledge](./Sharing-Knowledge.md).  
4. Capture to assist recall in the short term.  
  
## Tactics  
These tactics below are moves to make in your system in order to develop your knowledge. They assume the use of a note-taking tool that allows you to make links but they should be broadly applicable.  
  
1. The [Curiosity List](./Curiosity-List.md) inspires and guides your learning.   
2. The [Guide Note](./Guide-Note.md) is a memory cache and playbook for a set of related steps.  
3. The [Placeholder Note](../Placeholder%20Note.md) is a bookmark for ideas you may want to explore later.  
4. The [Resource List](Resource%20List.md) is a greatest hits album for your most-used tools and techniques.
