# Cases

## Nominative
Marks the subject of the sentence.

### Suffixes

| Number   | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
| -------- | --------- | -------- | ------ |
| Singular | ...       | ...      | ...       |
| Plural   | -οι       | -αί      | -α     |


## Accusative
Marks the direct object of the sentence.

### Suffixes

| Number   | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
| -------- | --------- | -------- | ------ |
| Singular | ...       | ...      | ...    |
| Plural   | -ους      | -άς      | -α     |

## Dative
Marks the indirect object, instrument, or beneficiary of the sentence.

The dative case an alternate with a proposition. "She is bringing the man *fruit*" uses the dative while "She is bringing fruit *to the man*" uses a preposition.

- A verb like 

## Genitive
Marks a relationship between nouns or as being the argument of a particular verb.

### Relationships between nouns
In the case of marking relationships between nouns, the interpretation of the genitive is dependent on the meaning of the noun that the genitive is related to. "of stone" appearing next to "house" implies a house made of stone because a house is made of something.

### Verbal Arguments
Some verbs require a genitive argument. For example, verbs of touching like ἅπτομαι.
