# La Finca Indonesia, Bourbon Sidra  
  
From Nariño, Colombia, **Prodigal Coffee** roasts this washed Sidra variety from La Fina Indonesia:  
  
> Coffee cherries for this lot are harvested only after reading 22 on the Brix scale. The cherries are washed after floating to remove defects, then dry-fermented in tanks for 48 hours before depulping. They undergo yet another fermentation for 60 hours, followed by a rinse. Finally the coffee is dried on partially covered patios for 15-20 days.  
  
# The Review  
  
## Smell  
The dry fragrance is fruited -- like plump, sweet blueberries. The cup is a cavalcade of scents: peaches, cinnamon, walnut, rainwater, and that blueberry note.  
  
## Taste  
The first sip drops its tropical fruit cornucopia payload and yields once giant smile. The arrival and development are nearly indistinguishable as incredibly concentrated tropical fruit expands over the palate, lasting longer than usual fruited flash one finds in tasty coffee. The topical fruit cornucopia is dominated by mango (think of it's sweetness and spice), pineapple (tart and juice), and banana (round, a little ferment-y). Something about the coffee places me on a Caribbean cruise ship, surrounded by sea air, standing at a fruit buffet. As the acidity begins to decay, it morphs into a sustained, memorable cherry note. The medium body supports the fruit that just keeps coming, and coming. The palate his with a flash of near-jerky savory sensation and then left with a woody bark and walnut vibe that sticks around for a long time.   
  
## Thoughts  
Incredible. This entry from **Prodigal Coffee** is one for the memory books. With the muscularity of dearly remembered Kenyan coffees and a fruit collage that surpasses almost any reference point, this Sidra trivializes all other uses of the *fruit bomb* moniker. There will surely be those who see it as one-dimensional, overly acidic, or just "too much", but this is an unparalleled coffee experience for me. If **Prodigal Coffee** can take me on memorable adventures like this, however intermittently their supply is available, I'm here for it.
