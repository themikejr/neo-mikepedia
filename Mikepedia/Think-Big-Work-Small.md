# Think Big, Work Small  
*Take very small steps as you run toward that grand vision.*  
  
It is important to have a vision, mission, and strategy for products that you build. When we **Think Big**, we take a look at the landscape that we hope to enter and take stock of what we can, should, and want to be. In reality it's almost impossible to know how to reach that big vision --- what path to take, how to implement each subsystem, etc... When we **Work Small** we take small steps to give space for learning and recalibration. We [build to learn](build%20to%20learn.md).  
  
A common criticism of [Agile](./Agile.md) software development methods is that the team may be working fast, but they have no strategy, they've conducted no deep research into what users need, and they have no architectural vision. This is when teams **Work Small** but don't **Think Big**.  
  
A common criticism of [Waterfall](./Waterfall.md) software development approaches is that lots of good thinking about vision, strategy, and architecture may take place but is pursued in large risky steps that are hard to undo as the team learns and problems are encountered. This is when teams **Think Big** but don't **Work Small**.   
  
**Think Big**, **Work Small** can be employed fractally on software projects. It can be how the project as a whole is executed, how features are prioritized, how features are implemented, and how the product is released.  
  
This is similar to the biomechanics of [Cycling Cadence](Cycling%20Cadence.md) and [Running Cadence](Running%20Cadence.md).
