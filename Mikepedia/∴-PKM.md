PKM, or [Personal Knowledge Management](./Personal-Knowledge-Management.md) is an emerging field of practice where knowledge workers and enthusiasts construct workflows for [Collecting](./Collecting-Information.md), [Developing](./Developing-Knowledge.md), and [Sharing Knowledge](./Sharing-Knowledge.md). Despite all the geeky goodness in debating workflows and tools, perhaps the largest benefit of a PKM practice is engaging in [Active Thinking](./active-thinking.md).  
  
At the risk of developing [Meta Expertise](./Meta-Expertise.md), I create notes about PKM as I pursue these practices myself. I'm also developing a list of [resources for exploring PKM](./Resources-for-Exploring-PKM.md).  
  
I've recently completed the *[Linking Your Thinking](https://linkingyourthinking.com)* workshop. During the [showcase](./Showcase.md) some folks were interested in [my reading workflow](./My-Reading-Workflow.md) and [my spark workflow](./My-Spark-Workflow.md).  
  
## Writing  
Writing is a crucial aspect of the PKM process. [writing is cathartic](./writing-is-cathartic.md). [writing aids understanding](./writing-aids-understanding.md).
