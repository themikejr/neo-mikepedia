PKM, or [Personal Knowledge Management](./Personal-Knowledge-Management.md) is an emerging field of practice where knowledge workers and enthusiasts construct workflows for [Collecting](./Collecting-Information.md), [Developing](./Developing-Knowledge.md), and [Producing Knowledge](./Producing-Knowledge.md). Despite all the geeky goodness in debating workflows and tools, perhaps the largest benefit of a PKM practice is engaging in [Active Thinking](./active-thinking.md).  
  
I create notes about PKM as I pursue employing these practices myself. I do not want my PKM practice to merely be [Meta Expertise](../Cards/Meta%20Expertise.md), but admittedly, I enjoy the topic very much. This month, I've been attending the the *[Linking Your Thinking](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/)* workshop. I've also been accumulating a list of [resources for exploring PKM](./Resources-for-Exploring-PKM.md)(./Meta-Expertise.md).
