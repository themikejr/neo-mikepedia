# ∴ PKM

PKM, or [Personal Knowledge Management](Personal%20Knowledge%20Management.md) is an emerging field of practice where knowledge workers and enthusiasts engage in [Collecting Information](Collecting%20Information.md), [Developing Knowledge](Developing%20Knowledge.md), and [Producing Knowledge.](Producing%20Knowledge..md) Perhaps the largest benefit of PKM practices is engaging in [Active Thinking](Active%20Thinking.md).

I create notes about PKM as I pursue employing these practices myself. I do not want to become a [Metaexpert](Metaexpert.md).

# Writing
Writing is a crucial aspect of the PKM process. [writing is cathartic](writing%20is%20cathartic.md). [writing aids understanding](writing%20aids%20understanding.md).
