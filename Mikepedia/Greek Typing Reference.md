# Keyboards
I use the default *Greek Polytonic* keyboards on Windows 11 and macOS. 

# Single Diacritics

## Accents
Accents are typed using prefix keys. Type the prefix key, then the letter that should be accented.

| Type       | Prefix Key | Example |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------- |
| Acute      | `;`        | ά       |
| Grave      | `]`        | ὰ       |
| Circumflex | `[`        | ᾶ       |

## Breath Marks
Breath marks are typed using prefix keys. Type the prefix key, then the letter that should have a breathing mark.

| Type   | Prefix Key | Example |
| ------ | ---------- | ------- |
| Smooth | `'`        | ὀ       |
| Rough  | `"`        | ὁ       |

## Iota Subscript
Iota Subscripts are typed using a prefix key. Type the prefix key, then the letter that should have a breathing mark.

| Type           | Prefix Key  | Example |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------- |
| Iota Subscript | `<Shift> [` | ῳ       |

# Combined Diacritics
More complex diacritics are typed with a prefix key. Sometimes a modifier is applied to the prefix key. Type the prefix key (with modifier if applicable) and then the letter

Note: `<AltGr>` is also known as "right alt", that is, the `<Alt>` key found at the right of the space bar on many keyboards. If `<AltGr>` is not accessible or uncomfortable to use, Windows systems allow using `<Ctrl> + <Alt>` instead.  

| Type                        | Prefix Key    | Example |
| --------------------------- | ------------- | ------- |
| Smooth Breath + Acute       | `/`           | ἄ       |
| Rough Breath + Acute        | `?`           | ἥ       |
| Circumflex + Iota Subscript | `<AltGr> + [` | ῷ       |
| Smooth Breath + Circumflex  | `=`           | ἶ       |
