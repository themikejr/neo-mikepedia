Conjunctions will have a lot of overlap between languages, but the nearest equivalent will not be an exact match.  
  
# καί  
- Connects two words together with the same part of speech (two nouns, two verbs, adjectives, clauses, etc...)  
- You may find many different interpretations of what καί means. One way to think about this is that *any* relationship holds between the two things it connects. It is not specifying the relationship, just saying that there is one.  
- The relationship could be that the two stated things are in a relationship of similarity or one of dissimilarity.   
- The meaning of the connected items and the context plays a large role in defining what the relationship is.
