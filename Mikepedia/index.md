Welcome to the public-facing portion of my **memex**. This is a place where I explore ideas using linked notes. If you're interested in notes, linked thought, and personal knowledge management, you may want to dive into [∴ PKM](./%E2%88%B4-PKM.md).  
  
If you are interested in ancient Greek or linguistics, check out  my notes on learning (Koine) [∴ Greek](./%E2%88%B4-Greek.md). I also have thoughts on [∴ Software Development](./%E2%88%B4-Software-Development.md). When I write notes on coffee experiences, they land in [∴ Coffee Journal](./%E2%88%B4-Coffee-Journal.md). I've also started capturing some of the more interesting [∴ AI Dialogues](./%E2%88%B4-AI-Dialogues.md).
