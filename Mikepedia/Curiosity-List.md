# Curiosity List  
  
A **Curiosity List** is a note that contains things you've encountered that spark your interest. Often, a [Virtuous Cycle](Virtuous%20Cycle.md) emerges where seeking out a few interesting things can cause you to become more interested and engaged. A note like this is especially helpful when starting a new job or joining a new team. Example:  
  
```markdown  
# Things to look up  
  
- redis  
- observer pattern  
- clean code (uncle bob?)  
- signals  
- DRS (project)  
- UI as a thin layer  
```  
  
The **Curiosity List** is the a perfect jumping off point for [Developing Knowledge](./Developing-Knowledge.md). Items on the list can become individual notes. In working on the notes, domains of knowledge will emerge from the fog. This is your way into making sense of the world. The list itself doesn't need to be a canonical source for a particular domain or area of interest. It's just a hodge-podge that generates clean motivational energy. If you find yourself short on work as an intern or junior, pull out the list and start making sense of things.  
  
# An Anecdote  
My first job as a software developer was at a mid-size regional bank. While the context was a bit bland, my curiosity made it an exciting and memorable season. From day one I was *inundated* with acronyms, terms, team names, software development patterns, and other jargon. The one thing I made sure to do was that when I heard a term mentioned that I wasn't familiar with, I quickly wrote it down on a notepad. Lists like these were curiosity fuel. Time spent looking the items up online or asking someone about was always worth it. As I sought answers, my curiosity branched out into new directions and I was perceived as someone with a hunger to understand. I quickly found that I was able to quickly explain these things to others that were just starting out.
