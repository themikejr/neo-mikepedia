# The Two Modes of Reading  
  
When we *read* -- that is when we consume ideas -- there are two modes that we tend to inhabit: **The Learning Mode** and **The Critical Mode**. While both are necessary, they both enable different types of conclusions. Operating solely in mode or the other puts one at risk of seeing less of the whole than they otherwise might be able to.  
  
**The Learning Mode** is one of submission. We come to the text to be taught that which we don't know that which we aren't aware that we do not know --- the unknowns and the unknown unknows. This mode is the posture of a student sitting with a teacher. By expecting to learn we engender the very conditions that make it possible. This mode encourages the acquisition of knowledge both by integrating new ideas into ourselves and synthesizing previously known concepts with each other in new ways. We might expect to bring a new concreteness to ideas we've been working on or a new perspective to look at concepts from.  
  
**The Critical Mode** is one of superiority. We come to text to assert that which we know onto the text. This mode is the posture of a teacher applying their system or methodology onto some other work. By expecting to find flaws on the object of our work, we find gaps -- logical spaces that are shaped liked ideas that we bring into the text. This mode encourages evaluation of the object of our study in light of our current knowledge.  
  
**The Learning Mode** and **The Critical Mode** are similar in that they are both dependent on the current state of ourselves, that is the knowledge we bring to the encounter. From this perspective, we may expect the conclusions we reach via both modes for a given object of study to change over time as we change. Similarly, both modes can bring new understanding to them.   
  
The modes are different from each other by means of the precedence consciously give our current understanding in the encounter. **The Learning Mode** is more open to the unknown and it thus more conducive to engendering a sense of beauty, mystery, and transcendence. In contrast, **The Critical Mode** employs our knowledge as a filter to the object of study. We protect ourselves from the errors of others. In this mode we are more likely to find shortcomings or missing puzzle pieces. The act of seeing what is missing is essential to fueling our seeking and striving for new and more relevant ways to frame questions and further knowledge pursuits.  
  
While both modes are necessary for healthy thinking, when we aren't consciously aware of our current working mode we risk accepting or writing off more than is warranted. Intentionally bringing modality is like being able to the same object in different spectrums of light. While we are likely to be more accustomed with one spectrum than another, both offer valuable perspectives as we seek to learn, critique, review, and synthesize.
