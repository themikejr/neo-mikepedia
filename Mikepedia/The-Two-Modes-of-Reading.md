# The Two Modes of Reading  
When we *read* -- that is when we consume ideas -- there are two modes that we tend to inhabit: **The Learning Mode** and **The Critical Mode**. While both are necessary, they both encourage a different set of possible conclusion. This means that one sometimes works to the exclusion of the other. Operating solely in a single mode risks seeing less of the whole than what otherwise might be possible.  
  
**The Learning Mode** is one of submission. We come to the text to be taught that which we don't know that which we aren't aware that we do not know --- the unknowns and the unknown unknows. This mode is the posture of a student sitting with a teacher. By expecting to learn we engender the very conditions that make it possible. This mode encourages the acquisition of knowledge both by integrating new ideas into ourselves and synthesizing previously known concepts with each other in new ways. We might expect to bring a new concreteness to ideas we've been working on or a new perspective to look at concepts from.  
  
**The Critical Mode** is one of superiority. We come to text to assert that which we know onto the text. This mode is the posture of a teacher applying their system or methodology onto some other work. By expecting to find flaws on the object of our work, we find gaps -- logical spaces that are shaped liked ideas that we bring into the text. This mode encourages evaluation of the object of our study in light of our current knowledge.  
  
**The Learning Mode** and **The Critical Mode** are similar in that they are both dependent on the current state of ourselves, that is the knowledge we bring to the encounter. From this perspective, we may expect the conclusions we reach via both modes for a given object of study to change over time as we change. Similarly, both modes can bring new understanding to them.   
  
The modes are different from each other by means of the precedence consciously give our current understanding in the encounter. **The Learning Mode** is more open to the unknown and it thus more conducive to engendering a sense of beauty, mystery, and transcendence. In contrast, **The Critical Mode** employs our knowledge as a filter to the object of study. We protect ourselves from the errors of others. In this mode we are more likely to find shortcomings or missing puzzle pieces. The act of seeing what is missing is essential to fueling our seeking and striving for new and more relevant ways to frame questions and further knowledge pursuits.  
  
While both modes are necessary for healthy thinking, when we aren't consciously aware of our current working mode we risk accepting or writing off more than is warranted. Intentionally bringing modality is like being able to the same object in different spectrums of light. While we are likely to be more accustomed with one spectrum than another, both offer valuable perspectives as we seek to learn, critique, review, and synthesize.

C.S. Lewis on the idea of Scriptural Authority, from *The Weight of Glory*:  
  
> The scriptural picture of heaven is therefore just as symbolical as the picture which our desire, unaided, invents for itself; heaven is not really full of jewelry any more than it is really the beauty of Nature, or a fine piece of music. The difference is that the scriptural imagery has authority. It comes to us from writers who were closer to God than we, and it has stood the test of Christian experience down the centuries. The natural appeal of this authoritative imagery is to me, at first, very small. At first sight it chills, rather than awakes, my desire. And that is just what I ought to expect. If Christianity could tell me no more of the far-off land than my own temperament led me to surmise already, then Christianity would be no higher than myself. If it has more to give me, I expect it to be less immediately attractive than "my own stuff." Sophocles at first seems dull and cold to the boy who has only reached Shelley. If our religion is something objective, then we must never avert our eyes from those elements in it which seem puzzling or repellent; for it will be precisely the puzzling or the repellent which conceals what we do not yet know and need to know.
