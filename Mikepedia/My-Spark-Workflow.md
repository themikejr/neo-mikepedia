# My Sparks Workflow  
  
Throughout the day my brain is generating questions, ideas, and connections. If I don't record them so that I know I can find them later I tend to wonder if 50% of what my brain is doing in a given day is a waste! To combat this **FOMO** of my own ideas, I've found a helpful workflow in my PKM system.   
  
In my daily note, I keep a bulleted list that I treat as a log. It contains things that happened, ideas that I had, etc... When I have an idea that seems like it might be a good one, I prefix it with the tag `#spark`. For example:  
  
```markdown  
2023.03.01  
  
- 30 minute run  
- #spark familiarity makes us blind  
- too many meetings today  
```  
  
Then, at some regular interval, I can review of the bullet points in my daily log that have been tagged with with `#spark`. I do this with a query via the **dataview** Obsidian plugin:  
  
- #spark Familiarity breeds content, familiarity makes us blind, etc... (need to write a note about that)  
- #spark all creative endeavors are in essence a novel combination of existing things. A second brain and practice associated with it provides the elements ripe for creative combination.  
- #spark how can I relate the idea of "thin vertical slices" to writing or other creative endeavors?  
- #spark re: complementarian vs egalitarian debate: "who's in charge" is the wrong question and perhaps one that is antithetical to the gospel itself. (While listening to podcast by Barnewall, author of *Neither Complementarian or Egalitarian*). I bet Complementarian and Egalitarianism are issues that could be diagonalized.  
- #spark a daily prayer book website with graded levels of Greek website with graded levels of Greek verses and prayers  
- #spark a series of posts examining cultural issues, figures, events, from a emplotted viewpoint of creation, fall, redemption.  
- #spark article: ways I have recovered from and fought with my RSI / Carpal Tunnel  
- #spark article: why I want to learn koine greek  
- #spark Humility as the restoration of creature hood.  
- #spark  to show the “result” of alignment to people making an alignment, give some feedback UI so that they can see what the style of the alignment has an impact  
- #spark ER++ asset links *are* or *could be* **ANNOTATIONS**. The macula data creation tools could be used to create the ER++ asset links  
- #spark is being able to translate between all languages a tower of babel project?  
- #spark My uncertainty in what to write and how to share it seems to be because I haven't committed to an area of study or topic. Usually for certain topics and areas of study there are already established circles that I could join or places to share ideas.  
- #spark the web is a graph of trees  
- #spark Impedance mismatch between trees and graphs  
- #spark Luhmann's zettelkasten was a tree, linked to itself with a graph  
- #spark consuming information is like eating. active thinking and notemaking is like exercise.  
- #spark I seem to be the type of person that even in the most desirable context will (1) find issues/problems and (2) begin thinking of other contexts to seek  
- #spark A book that focuses on Christianity as a way to engage the world with stability and openness  
- #spark Use buttons in home note to navigate more easily navigate periodic notes on mobile  
  
  
This way, I can quickly capture what might be interesting ideas with no fear of losing sight of them later.
