*Concerning the arrangement of words and phrases.*  
  
- Greek has a very flexible word order. You will encounter multiple orders of Subject, Verb, and Object.  
- Linguists debate whether SVO or VSO is the default order for Greek.  
- "Basic order" is the order used when no special meaning is conveyed or context doesn't trigger a change.  
- The object normally follows the verb.  
  
# Roles  
  
## Subject  
  
## Verb  
  
## Direct Object  
Effected by the action of the verb in some way.  
  
# Other Terms  
  
## Agreement  
Matching between subject and verb is called "agreement". This is discussed with respect to things like number (singular vs. plural) and possibly gender.  
  
- There is a rule from Attic Greek that says a non-human plural neuter subject can take a singular verb. This rule is inconsistently applied in the NT.  
- Verbs can take multiple argument patterns aka *argument realizations*.
