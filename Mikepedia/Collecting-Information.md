# Collecting Information  
*Capture that thought!*  
  
Collecting Information is the *input* stage of managing knowledge. In order to manage knowledge, it must be collected. We encounter a quote or idea that sparks something in us and we naturally desire to capture that idea and store it somewhere. The [Commonplace Book](Commonplace%20Book.md) tradition is the analog version of this proclivity. In the digital realm, we store text in our various PKM systems because we don't want to lose it --- we want access to it later.  
  
Through [GTD](GTD.md), David Allen popularized the idea that when our minds generate an idea, it needs to be captured somewhere. He famously said:  
  
> Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them.   
  
There is truth in that statement. This emphasis on the capturing [Personal Knowledge Management](./Personal-Knowledge-Management.md) is important (what is there to manage if we don't *have* it?) but one stops there, a PKM system will be deficient. We are always at risk of the [Collector's Fallacy](./Collector's-Fallacy.md). Capturing information that seems important or sparks joy is a good thing to do but if we never develop that information further, our systems will at best become a graveyard of sparks --- a collection of ideas that once excited us but have long since died out. At worst, a PKM system that only focuses on collecting and capturing will induce anxiety, a sense that that we could be doing so much more with all that we have captured but without an understanding of how to develop and manage that knowledge, we just feel like we are missing out or are creating more work for ourselves.  
  
Thankfully, as we begin [Developing Knowledge](./Developing-Knowledge.md), we can gain clarity from that which we collect. If one is stuck with merely collecting information, don't stop there. Push through and find ways to develop.
