# ∴ Software Development  
  
This is a higher-order note that acts as a hub for my **SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT** notes.  
  
When it comes to **METHOD**, many people speak in terms of [Agile](./Agile.md) and [Waterfall](./Waterfall.md). It's probably more important to [Think Big, Work Small](./Think-Big-Work-Small.md).  
  
**Data Structures** are interesting and they are everywhere. [Trees](./Tree.md) are naturally intuitive. [Graphs](./Graph.md) are surprisingly flexible.  
  
Stuck or overwhelmed? [PKM for Coders](./PKM-for-Coders.md) might help.  
  
Lately I've been learning a bit of **Django**. See [Django Project Creation Guide](./Django-Project-Creation-Guide.md).
