# Graphs are flexible  
  
In observing that [Trees are rigid](./Trees-are-rigid.md), a [Graph](./Graph.md) (aka a "web") is often suggested as a more flexible alternative. **graphs** allow connections can be made without having to fit into a hierarchy. Berners-Lee suggests:  
  
> ...a "web" of notes with links (like references) between them is far more useful than a fixed hierarchical system. When describing a complex system, many people resort to diagrams with circles and arrows. Circles and arrows leave one free to describe the interrelationships between things in a way that tables, for example, do not. The system we need is like a diagram of circles and arrows, where circles and arrows can stand for anything.  
  
Linked graphs are useful to think about as a flexible solution for organizing people, [âˆ´ PKM](./%E2%88%B4-PKM.md) systems, and other things. **[|graphs](./Graph.md)** are not as intuitive as **[trees](./Tree.md)** are. Despite their flexibility, they can be disorienting to navigate. Structure tends to emerge from them rather than being determined beforehand. This can make retrieval more difficult. I've found [thinking in graphs for managing personal knowledge](./Thinking-in-graphs-for-managing-personal-knowledge.md) to be useful.
