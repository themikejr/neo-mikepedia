# Local-First Software  
**Local-First Software** is an approach to building software applications that favors storing data on local devices. The software is then designed to work with this local data rather than always depending on a server in cloud for every change. Collaboration and synchronization are then enabled on top of the local storage provided. [CRDT](../CRDT.md)s are an emerging approach for enabling collaboration and synchronization.
