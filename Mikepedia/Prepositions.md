title: Prepositions  
---  
*A word that relates what comes after it to something else in the clause.*  
  
Example: the boy *in* the room  
  
Prepositions are not easily mapped to a single gloss. The meaning of a preposition can change depending on the case of the noun it refers to.  
  
# Examples   
  
## πρός  
  
### Accusative  
Often associated with direction *toward* an animate object.  
  
```  
πρός [τόν | τήν | τό] <animate object>  
```  
  
But, the type of verb can impact the meaning of the preposition. A *stative* verb like "was" influences πρός to imply being in the company of someone. (e.g. John 1:1, πρὸς τὸν θεόν).  
  
## ἐν  
Proclitic (accented with the following word). Only allows the dative case.  
  
### Dative  
Marks a location of something being *in* something else. With *stative* verbs it signals something being in a particular state. It can also mean something like "into". It may also introduce an instrument. In these cases it is better glossed as *with*.  
  
## ἀπό  
Prepositions ending in vowels have special contraction rules:  
  
| Following sound | example          |  
| --------------- | ---------------- |  
| consonant       | **ἀπὸ** σκηνῆς   |  
| vowel (smooth)  | **ἀπ'** ἀνθρώπου |  
| vowel (rough)   | **ἀφ'** ἵππου    |  
  
### Genitive  
ἀπό only takes the genitive case. Prepositions in the genitive case often signify motion or direction away from something.   
  
- motion or direction away from something  
- source of something
