# Tree (Data Structure)  
*I organize with hierarchy.*  
  
A **TREE** is data type that represents things (nodes) in a hierarchy. A node in the tree can have a parent, zero to many siblings, and zero to many children. The node at the "top" which has no parents is known as the **ROOT** node. A node with no children is known as a **LEAF** node. In the computer world, things like **HTML**, **XML**, **DIRECTORY STRUCTURES**, and **URL PATHS** are tree-like. We also tend to represent families and organizational structures in trees. Trees can be organized and sorted in ways that makes searching and retrieval very efficient.  
  
A **TREE** is a specific form of a **[Graph](../Graph.md)** which is a more generic data type. In terms of **GRAPH** theory, a **TREE** is an:  
  
> ...[undirected graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undirected_graph "Undirected graph") in which any two [vertices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(graph_theory) "Vertex (graph theory)") are connected by _exactly one_ [path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(graph_theory) "Path (graph theory)"), or equivalently a [connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_graph "Connected graph") [acyclic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_(graph_theory) "Cycle (graph theory)") undirected graph. (*[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory))*)  
  
**TREE**s are eminently useful and quite intuitive for most people. When it comes to organizing digital information or created classes or categories, **TREE**s are often used by default. We tend to think in terms of hierarchy even when it is not necessary. **TREE**s can be the wrong choice when:  
  
1. there is no inherent hierarchy in what is being represented.  
2. the hierarchy of what is being represented is emergent or undetermined.  
3. the hierarchy of what is being represented may need to change.  
  
In [Personal Knowledge Management](./Personal-Knowledge-Management.md), it is common to start by seeking the right folder structure (a **TREE**) to store one's information. In these cases, [Thinking in graphs for managing personal knowledge](./Thinking-in-graphs-for-managing-personal-knowledge.md) can be useful.
