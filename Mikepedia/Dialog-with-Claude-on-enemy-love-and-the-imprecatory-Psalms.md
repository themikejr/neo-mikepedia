# Dialogue with Claude on enemy-love and the imprecatory Psalms  
*2023.05.30*  
  
**Mike:** I'm a Christian. I often read the Old Testament Psalms devotionally. While I appreciate the broad spectrum of emotions expressed in the poetry, I often get tripped up on comments about "enemies" and how I should interpret these as a Christian. The antagonistic approach taken towards one's enemies seems contradictory to (1) the arc of the abrahamic covenant and (2) the teaching of the New Testament. It's possible I'm thinking about this incorrectly. I'm hoping that you could help me understand how such statements in hebrew poetry have been interpreted by Christians throughout history. I'm interested in learning. It's ok if some contradictory approaches are presented. If there are examples to learn from in the New Testament please present them, otherwise, let's start with the early church fathers.  
  
**Claude:**  This is a great question that many Christians grapple with. There are a few ways Christians have interpreted the "imprecatory" psalms that call for judgment on enemies:  
  
1. Focus on the Psalmist's emotions, not actions. The psalms are expressive poetry, not prescriptive commands. The Psalmist is expressing raw emotion to God, not necessarily saying we should act the same way. We can appreciate the honesty and passion without emulating the attitude.  
2. See the psalms as prophetic. Some early Christians saw the psalms as prophesying the judgment of God on evil and evildoers. So the psalms point forward to God's ultimate justice, not our own actions.  
3. Interpret "enemies" spiritually. Some Christians interpret the psalms as referring to spiritual enemies - sin, temptation, Satan. So we should read them as poetic prayers for victory over evil in our own lives and the world.   
4. Balance with the "arc of the covenant" and Jesus' teachings. As you noted, the call for judgment on enemies seems out of step with the overall movement of Scripture towards grace, mercy, and love of enemies. Many Christians argue we should interpret the psalms through the lens of Christ's teachings and example. Jesus prayed for his enemies, so we should do likewise.  
  
Examples of these approaches:  
  
- Augustine argued we should see the psalms as prophesying God's judgment, not our own, and balance them with NT love.  
- Chrysostom said the psalms refer to spiritual enemies, not human ones. We should pray for victory over sin and temptation.  
- Aquinas said the psalms expressed human emotion to make prayers relatable, but we should not emulate that attitude - we should love our enemies as Jesus taught.   
- Bonhoeffer argued that the psalms are prayers for God's judgment on evil itself, not human enemies. We should pray for the end of injustice and suffering in the world.  
- C.S. Lewis said we should appreciate the psalms as passionate human prayers, but follow Jesus' teachings in our own lives. The psalms show it's ok to express raw emotion to God!  
  
I hope this helps give you some perspective and approaches to interpret the "imprecatory" psalms as a Christian. Let me know if you have any other questions!  
  
**Mike:** This is a helpful start.  
  
Regarding "focus on the Psalmist's emotions, not actions" I understand the intent behind such a statement but it seems to not bear much weight in my analysis. In using the Psalms devotionally, I am trying to cultivate an inner world that is in line with the tradition of scripture. Sometimes I see emotions expressed in the psalms that seem as though I should not cultivate.  
  
Augustine's suggestion to see the imprecatory psalms that call for judgment as a prophecy of God's judgment makes sense, but I wonder to what degree it is desirable to cultivate a strong desire for judgment when I know that in the eyes of Christianity, everyone is culpable to one degree or another.  
  
Chryostom's suggestion to interpret these statements spiritually is something I do often, but I wonder to what degree this is warranted by a Christian hermeneutic. I'm interested in hearing more about what Chrysostom had to say about the basis for such an interpretation and the extent to which he applied it.  
  
I'm also interested in more examples of answers to this question from church fathers.  
  
**Claude:** You raise some good points. Let me elaborate on some of these perspectives:  
  
You're right that simply focusing on emotions is not fully satisfying. The psalms are meant for spiritual formation, so the attitudes and desires they cultivate matter. Augustine's view that they prophecy God's judgment is better, but still problematic if it cultivates a vengeful spirit in us. You're wise to note that we are all culpable before God.  
  
Chrysostom argued that a "spiritual" interpretation was justified because the psalms were inspired by the Spirit, who speaks of spiritual realities. But you're right that we must ground this in a Christian hermeneutic guided by Jesus' teachings. For Chrysostom, a spiritual interpretation meant seeing sin and Satan as our "enemies", not human ones. But he still said we should love our human enemies, as Jesus taught.  
  
Other church fathers:  
  
- Origen also advocated a spiritual interpretation. He argued God's enemies were spiritual powers of evil, not flesh and blood. Our battle is not against humans but sin and darkness.  
- Jerome said the psalms teach us to hate sin, not sinners. We should pray for judgment on sin itself, not delight in the destruction of any human. Our anger should be turned against the evil within us, not people.  
- Athanasius said the psalms were written for our instruction, so we must interpret them through the lense of the NT. Jesus taught us to love our enemies and pray for them. The psalms should move us to pray against sin and injustice, not human opponents.   
- Cyril of Alexandria also argued we should interpret the OT through the teachings of Christ in the NT. The psalms teach us to pray against the spiritual forces of evil in the world, not human enemies. Our battle is against sin, not people.  
  
In summary, while a few fathers focused on prophetic interpretation, most argued for a spiritual interpretation that prays against sin, not people, and is guided by Jesus' teachings to love our human enemies. The overall arc of Scripture and Jesus' example, not isolated psalms, should shape our attitude.  
  
Does this help give more perspective on how early Christians interpreted these psalms? Let me know if you have any other questions!  
  
**Mike:** This is making a bit more sense. Jesus' teaching to love our enemies and Paul's statement in Ephesians("For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.") seem to provide a warrant to focus on the spiritual aspects of evil and to target them as people (surely there is a better way to say that last part).  
  
I'm curious -- following this line of questioning, are there references or allusions to imprecatory psalms in the New Testament that demonstrate any sort of interpretation (of any type) of the statements calling for judgements on human enemies?  
  
**Claude:**  You're right that Jesus' teachings and Paul's statements provide good justification for interpreting the psalms' references to "enemies" spiritually - as evil spiritual forces, not human opponents. Focusing our anger and desires for judgment on sin and spiritual darkness, not people, aligns well with the ethic of love in the New Testament.  
  
As for NT references to the imprecatory psalms, there are a few:  
  
1. In Acts 1:20, Peter quotes Psalm 109:8, an imprecatory psalm, in reference to Judas' betrayal of Jesus. But Peter applies it to the "enemies" of Jesus (the religious leaders), not their own personal human enemies. This suggests spiritualizing the psalms.  
2. In Romans 11:9-10, Paul quotes Psalms 69:22-23, another imprecatory psalm, in reference to Israelites who rejected the gospel. But again, he applies it to these spiritual "enemies of the gospel," not personal human foes. This also suggests a spiritual interpretation.   
3. In Revelation 6:9-10, the martyred saints in heaven cry out for God to avenge their blood "on those who dwell on the earth." This alludes to the cries for divine vengeance in the psalms. But in Revelation, the "enemies" and targets of judgment are clearly spiritual - those allied with the forces of evil, not flesh and blood. This also encourages a spiritual reading of the psalms.  
4. In Luke 23:34, Jesus quotes Psalm 22 while on the cross, but rather than calling for judgment on his enemies, he prays, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing." Jesus provides a radical reinterpretation of this psalm of lament, focusing on mercy rather than vengeance. This colors how we should read the rest of the psalms.  
  
So while the NT does allude to some imprecatory psalms, it applies them to spiritual enemies - sin, evil, dark spiritual powers - rather than personal human foes. And Jesus' example of grace and mercy on the cross reframes how we should interpret calls for judgment in the psalms.  
  
Overall, the NT guidance clearly points to reading the psalms, even the imprecatory ones, through a lens of grace, mercy, and spiritual warfare against evil - not judgment of other people. Our battle is "not against flesh and blood."  
  
Does this help summarize some of the NT perspective on interpreting the imprecatory psalms? Let me know if you have any other questions!  
  
**Mike:** This part of the conversation is exemplary of the difficulty I myself have with this topic.  
  
In your example of Peter's use of Psalm 109 in Acts 1:20, it seems to be that Peter is indeed interpreting the "enemies" of Psalm 109 as resolving to a specific person, in this case, Judas.  
  
Your example of Luke 23:34 / Psalm 22 was also quite compelling when I read it, but when I looked at Psalm 22 more closely, it does not seem to contain any of the calls for judgment and punishment on enemies that we have been talking about. (Please correct me if I have missed something. I'm here to learn!)  
  
Your conclusion ("So while the NT does allude to some imprecatory psalms, it applies them to spiritual enemies - sin, evil, dark spiritual powers - rather than personal human foes. And Jesus' example of grace and mercy on the cross reframes how we should interpret calls for judgment in the psalms.") remains compelling but I'm not convinced by the examples you gave so far.  
  
**Claude:**  You make excellent points. I agree that my examples were not as compelling as I suggested, on closer examination. You're right to push back - it's the only way to gain deeper understanding. Let me reframe my perspective:  
  
You're correct that in Acts 1:20, Peter does apply Psalm 109's cry for judgment to the human figure of Judas. So this is an example of an NT author interpreting an imprecatory psalm as judgment on human enemies. I was mistaken on that one.  
  
You're also right that Psalm 22 itself does not contain the same level of imprecation as other psalms. Jesus' quoting of Psalm 22:1 on the cross does not directly speak to how we should interpret its cries for judgment. I overreached there.  
  
You're wise to be unconvinced by my initial examples. Here is a revised perspective:  
  
The NT does suggest spiritualizing some Psalms, like Paul in Romans 11 interpreting Psalm 69 as judgment on spiritual "enemies of the gospel." However, the NT is not consistent in this approach.  
  
Peter's use of Psalm 109 in Acts 1:20 does apply it to human enemies, Judas and the religious leaders. So at least some NT authors did interpret some imprecatory psalms as referring to judgment on human foes.  
  
Jesus' example of mercy on the cross is still instructive, but we cannot definitively say it shows how we should interpret the judgment aspect of Psalm 22 or other Psalms. Jesus was quoting Psalm 22:1, not its imprecations.  
  
So the NT does not provide definitive proof one way or the other on how we should interpret the harsher judgments in the psalms. There is tension.  
  
My view is we should follow Jesus' example of enemy-love and mercy as much as possible - but also recognize the Psalmists' honest cries for justice. We can pray for God's judgment on evil itself, injustice, and the spiritual forces behind human sin. We should avoid cultivating personal hatred or judgmentalism toward others. But we can bring even our angriest emotions honestly before God, as the Psalmists did.  
  
Does this revised perspective seem more balanced and well-supported? My intention is to have an open, honest discussion about these tensions, not provide simplistic "answers." Your pushback has helped refine and improve my own understanding - thank you! Please continue to call out any overreaches. I appreciate the dialogue.  
  
**Mike:** Thank you for acknowledging the tension here, sometimes it's helpful to just be reminded of that. Your revised conclusion that "...we should follow Jesus' example of enemy-love and mercy as much as possible - but also recognize the Psalmists' honest cries for justice..." seems like it's on the right track to me. If we accept this, I think we must admit that this a synthesis that does not seem to be directly supported with examples in the New Testament or early church fathers (unless perhaps you can provide some examples now that we've landed on this revised conclusion). Please let me know if you disagree with my analysis.  
  
I remain wont for a more cohesive and systematic tradition for interpreting these psalms. The harshness of attitude toward enemies is in my face every day when I read the psalms devotionally, like a rock in my shoe (to mix metaphors).  
  
The fact that Jesus brings Psalm 22 into play during the crucifixion is certainly weighty. There are so many psalms calling for the judgment of enemies that might otherwise be appropriate in this context. In terms of that ultimate McGuffin "certainty", this could still be deemed an argument for silence, but Jesus' attitude during the crucifixion is instructive nonetheless.  
  
**Claude:**  You make a perceptive point that my revised conclusion is more of a synthesis than something definitively proven from NT texts or early church fathers. You're right to note that. The tensions we've discussed remain, and there is no perfectly cohesive systematic answer.  
  
I can understand why the harsh cries for judgment in the psalms would feel like "a rock in your shoe" during devotional reading. Those passages continue to disturb me at times too, if I'm honest. You're wise to grapple openly with these tensions rather than ignore them.  
  
You make an interesting argument from silence regarding Jesus' choice of Psalm 22:1 on the cross. Of all the psalms Jesus could have quoted, he chose one that expresses anguish and lament, but not direct imprecation. This is worth reflecting on. Jesus modeled enemy-love at the very moment he had every reason for justifiable anger.  
  
A few other thoughts:  
  
1. The psalms express raw, honest emotion, but should not be taken as prescriptive commands for action. We can bring our angriest feelings to God, but then choose a response of grace.  
2. The arc of Scripture does move from judgment to grace, from "eye for an eye" to "turn the other cheek." So we should interpret the psalms through the lens of Christ.  
3. The psalms were meant for public worship. Perhaps the strongest curses reflect the corporate experience of unjust suffering, more so than personal vengeance. We can pray for justice and deliverance from evildoers, while also showing mercy.  
4. Spiritualizing enemies provides some help, but we must still wrestle with passages referring clearly to human foes. We can pray for change of heart, while trusting judgment to God.  
5. No one approach resolves all tensions. But if we follow Jesus, we'll err on the side of mercy, love, and forgiveness - while still crying out for justice, and bringing our honest anger before God.  
  
So in summary, the tension remains, but focusing on Jesus' example and teachings provides the best guidance we have. Praying for God's mercy, justice and deliverance - while showing grace and love to others - may be the most balanced approach. But open-eyed, honest engagement with the text is needed. Simplistic answers won't suffice.  
  
Does this help provide any further perspective? I appreciate your thoughtful and thought-provoking questions. Please continue to push back against anything that seems unhelpful or an overreach. This dialogue has certainly enhanced my own thinking!  
  
**Mike:** I think we are in agreement at some foundational level. "Simplistic answers won't suffice" is something we should cheerfully agree on. But in the spirit of acknowledging and exploring tension, let's look at your first point, which seems obviously true on one level but might be contradictory on another:  
  
"The psalms express raw, honest emotion, but should not be taken as prescriptive commands for action. We can bring our angriest feelings to God, but then choose a response of grace."  
  
Is it not "prescriptive" in at least one sense to say that we see the psalms expressing raw, honest emotion, and we should do likewise? This seems prescriptive, which is the opposite of the point you were trying to make. The reading or interpretation that you are attempting to use here though is that the way psalmists apply their emotions is not prescriptive, but the fact that they voice, apply, and pray their emotions _is_ in fact a positive example that we should take as prescriptive (i.e. do likewise). Let 's find a better way to try to express this idea.  
  
**Claude:** You make an insightful point. My statement was contradictory in a sense. Let me try to clarify:  
  
You're right that I implied we should follow the psalmists' example of honestly expressing emotion to God - which is a kind of prescriptive point. What I meant to convey is:  
  
The psalms demonstrate we can voice our rawest emotions to God without reservation. This is an example we should follow - we can be fully transparent with God.  
  
However, the specific ways the psalmists applied or acted on certain emotions, especially anger, are not necessarily prescriptive. We should not take their angriest imprecations as commands for how we should respond to or treat our enemies today.  
  
So a revised way to put it could be:  
  
The psalms show we can openly express any feeling to God, but they should not be taken as prescribing how we must act or respond. We can voice anger to God but choose grace toward others.  
  
You're right that I should not have implied the psalms are wholly non-prescriptive. A better way to say it is:  
  
The psalms demonstrate the freedom to be emotionally honest before God. But as for how we apply or act on emotions, especially anger, we must follow the guidance of Jesus and the New Testament.  
  
The psalms give us permission to be raw before God, as foundational prayer literature should. But for our actions and relationships, we have further revelation in Christ to guide us. Christ, not isolated imprecatory psalms, should shape our posture toward others.  
  
Does this provide more clarity and resolve the contradiction you insightfully pointed out? I appreciate you pushing me to articulate this more carefully and coherently. My thinking on this has developed further thanks to your feedback.  
  
Please continue to point out any inconsistencies, overreaches or areas that could benefit from clarification. I'm learning through this process as well!  
  
**Mike:** This is a little better. My western, post-enlightenment brain is still wishing an overall approach that feels more systematically coherent, but for now let's leave the conversation where it's at.  
  
**Claude:**  I understand the desire for a more systematic and coherent approach. These tensions in Scripture can be unsettling, and we long for clear resolutions.  
  
However, you are wise to recognize that in this area, differing perspectives have merit, and simple answers may elude us. As with many profound mysteries in life, we may have to live within a degree of ambiguity or paradox.  
  
Some final thoughts:  
  
- Focusing on following Jesus' example of grace and truth provides the surest guide, even if questions remain.  
- Reading Scripture holistically, balancing passages that disturb us with those that clarify, helps avoid distortion.   
- Honest, thoughtful engagement with Scripture, while seeking wisdom from others, leads closer to truth - even if certitude evades us.  
- Prayerfully reflecting on how to apply biblical truth in our context cultivates wisdom. But humility before God's Word is needed - we can't force it to match our preconceptions.  
- Tensions are not inherently bad. They can compel us to deeper understanding, even without "solving" them. We learn to live with complexity.  
  
I appreciate your willingness to thoughtfully engage these tensions rather than grasp too quickly for a forced resolution. Your example has encouraged me in my own desire to grow in wisdom, truth and grace.   
  
Thank you for a stimulating and nuanced discussion. My understanding of these issues - and approach in addressing them - has expanded through our conversation. I hope we can continue to explore profound and unsettling questions from Scripture together. There is always more to discover - and our shared reflections may help others along the way.  
  
Please feel free to continue the conversation whenever you have additional thoughts or questions to share. I appreciate any opportunity to learn and better point to greater truth.  
  
Grace and peace to you!
