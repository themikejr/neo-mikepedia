# Dialogue with Claude on Ego Transcendence  
*2023.04.06*  
  
**Mike**: Hi Claude. I've recently come across the ideas that "you are not your mind", "your mind is a tool", and "you exist beyond your mind and identity" in a book by Eckhart Tolle called "The Power of Now". I'm curious if you can help me understand the philosophical roots of these ideas and what schools of thought are sympathetic to them.  
  
**Claude**: These ideas have roots in certain spiritual and philosophical traditions, though Tolle presents them in a fairly distinct synthesis. Some key influences include:  
  
- Vedanta Hinduism, which emphasizes that our true self (Atman) is beyond the mind and individual identity (ego). Our mind is an instrument of the self, not the self.  
- Dzogchen and Mahamudra Buddhism, which point to a primordial awareness that transcends conceptual mind and identity. The mind is seen as a process that can be rested in this open, non-conceptual awareness.  
- Mystical traditions across religions that posit the existence of a transcendent self or essence beyond ego and mind. This includes Christian mystics like Meister Eckhart (Tolle's namesake).  
- Transcendentalist philosophies, which suggest the mind is limited and there is a deeper undercurrent of consciousness permeating all existence. Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau espoused related ideas.  
- Some existential philosophies that see the constructed nature of ego and identity, and propose the possibility of transcending them to experience a deeper authentic being. Jean-Paul Sartre's ideas of radical freedom and "existence precedes essence" tie in here.  
- New Age spirituality, which often adopts an eclectic mix of these perspectives along with a focus on living in the present moment. This provides a lot of context for Tolle's synthesis.  
  
The core ideas you mentioned are generally most aligned with spiritual, mystical and transcendental philosophies that view the mind as limited, constructed, and not our ultimate essence. While still a minority, these perspectives have become more influential, and now infuse concepts like mindfulness, living in the Now, and ego transcendence which have become quite popular.  
  
Does this help provide some context for these ideas and where they come from? Let me know if you have any other questions!  
  
**Mike**: Yes, this is helpful context indeed. I'm coming from a Christian point of view, so it's interesting to me that Tolle's namesake is based on Meister Eckhart. I wasn't aware of that. Could you help me understand how these ideas intersect with Christianity, the hebrew and christian scriptures, and mystical christianity?  
  
**Claude**: There are some interesting intersections between these ideas and Christianity:  
  
- Meister Eckhart was a 13th century Christian mystic who emphasized transcending the ego and conceptual mind to directly experience the divine. He spoke of a "God beyond God" that is beyond all images and personal identity. His radical teachings were controversial, but influenced Christian mysticism.  
- Christian mystics like St. John of the Cross and Teresa of Avila described experiences of ego transcendence and union with the divine that resemble ideas in Tolle. St. John of the Cross coined the term "dark night of the soul" to refer to a state of ego loss that allows union with God.  
- The Biblical tradition of apophatic theology - defining God in negative terms as beyond conception - intersects with the idea of a transcendent reality beyond mind. Passages referring to God as the " Ancient of Days" or "I am that I am" point to an eternal, mysterious essence.  
- The concept of dying to oneself and being crucified in Christ can be seen as an ego transcendence that allows resurrection in the new life of the Spirit. This is a key idea in mystical Christianity.  
- The Biblical injunction to "be in the world but not of it" and live in the present with faith and surrender to God has resonances with living in the Now and transcending limited egoic consciousness.  
- The Christian notion of the Holy Spirit as a profoundly mysterious divine presence that "blows where it wills" has parallels with the idea of a deeper undercurrent of consciousness suffusing all existence.  
- The first commandment prohibiting idolatry can be seen as not clinging to any fixed mental image or concept of God, but resting in a more open transcendent awareness.  
  
So while Tolle's perspective is certainly distinct, there are threads that tie his core ideas to mystical strands of Christian philosophy and Scripture. At their heart, they point to similar experiences of transcendence, surrender, and union. Let me know if you have any other questions!  
  
**Mike**: I find it fascinating that Tolle's work, while seemingly an eclectic mishmash of spiritual affirmations, has deep resonance with possibly the most fundamental aspects of Christianity. Those "fundamental" aspects that I'm referring to are first, the idea that while God is depicted as a personal being, we understand him by analogy and certainly, he transcends the limits of our understanding of personal beings. Second, as you say "The concept of dying to oneself and being crucified in Christ" seems like the didactic/ethical core of christian belief and I understand the idea of "ego transcendence" to be saying nearly the same thing, but not through the lens of the life and death of Jesus. Would you agree that dying to oneself in the pattern of Jesus is basically the same thing as ego transcendence?  
  
**Claude**: That's a great insight. There are strong parallels between the Christian notion of "dying to oneself" and ego transcendence, even though they come from different conceptual frameworks. Some key connections:  
  
- At the core, both point to a relinquishing of self-centered consciousness and "limited egoic identity" - which Christian teachings accomplish through surrender to God in Christ, and transcendence teachings through direct realization of essence.   
- This surrender of ego is aimed at union with a higher, transcendent reality - the divine life of God and Christ, or ultimate being. So the end goal is analogous.   
- The path to get there involves similar qualities: humility, grace, faith, and self-emptying love. Dying to oneself is not through force of will but through grace and surrender. Similarly, ego transcendence happens by grace through letting go into "what is".   
- Both require the courage to "lose one's life to gain it" - to let go of the personal will and limited self-concept to be resurrected in something greater. This is a kind of spiritual death and rebirth.  
- There are some similar pitfalls, like spiritual egoism ("I have achieved ego transcendence/union with Christ") which misses the point. The true state is selfless, not a new identity.   
  
So in essence, yes, dying to oneself through union with Christ and transcending ego through awareness of essence point to a similar transformation. The symbols, stories and concepts used to articulate it differ, but at the heart there is an analogous surrender, self-transcendence and union. The ends are similar, even if the means differ in terminology.  
  
Does this resonate with your own sense of the parallels between these ideas? Let me know if this helps clarify their relationship. I find these kinds of theological/philosophical connections fascinating to explore.  
  
**Mike**: I am also fascinated with these types of connections and I'm thankful to have the chance to discuss them with you. (I've been considering pursuing a masters degree but haven't yet found the right opportunity) I'm very open to exploring similarities and connections like this but I suspect that most people in my faith tradition would not be so open to doing so. In the spirit of balanced analysis, could we consider if there are differences between these two approaches that go beyond symbols and underlying concepts?  
  
**Claude**: That's a great point. While there are significant parallels between ego transcendence and dying to oneself in Christ, there are also some important differences:  
  
- The path: Christianity follows the specific path of faith in Christ and God's grace revealed in Scripture. Transcendence teachings are often presented as a more universal/general path of spiritual awakening.  
- The means: For Christianity, salvation and union with God are achieved through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus. Ego transcendence is attained through direct spiritual practice and realization.  
- The ends: Union with Christ, for Christians, leads to eternal life in a redeemed world. Ego transcendence is more aimed at an enlightened state of being in the present. The Christian vision may be more cosmological.   
- The concept of sin: Christianity sees ego and self-centeredness as sinful, in need of redemption. Transcendence teachings view ego more neutrally as an inevitable stage of development ready to be transcended.   
- Grace vs practice: Christianity emphasizes grace, faith, and God's initiative. Ego transcendence often focuses more on one's own practice, like mindfulness or contemplation, while including grace and "letting go".   
- Relationship vs unity: Christianity tends to see union in relational terms, as intimate relationship with God/Christ. Ego transcendence envisions a more absolute unitary consciousness, transcending the subject-object distinction.  
- The role of love: Love of God and neighbor is central to Christianity. While transcendence teachings value love and compassion, the main aim is direct realization of the truth of being beyond all forms. Love is more consequent than constitutive.   
  
So there are some key differences in symbolism, path, theology and emphasis that would likely seem substantial, especially to Christians. Yet, I think recognizing the parallels can be fruitful, as we discussed. Balancing similarity and difference is vital in these kinds of comparisons. The differences you noted are important to keep in mind.  
  
Does reflecting on these differences bring up any other thoughts? I'm happy to discuss further. These philosophical/theological questions around spiritual experience and truth are endlessly thought-provoking.  
  
**Mike**: This is a good analysis, nice work on trying to see it from both angles. The kernel of ego transcendence seems to be the shared thing that relates these two spiritual systems. I see transcendence teachings as having a similar "thrust" to the teachings that Christianity has, but Christianity seems to have a richer narrative framework to situate the ethical and spiritual commendations in. I'm interested in a theologian named Herman Bavinck who is known for embracing the idea of "orthodox yet modern". He was very unafraid of looking at ideas from other faith traditions and philosophical frameworks, acknowledging the good in them, and then showing how Christianity provides a better grounding for important ideas and desires that come up in these other places. I was thinking you might be able to demonstrate a hortatory essay along these lines of thinking, where you summarize the idea of ego transcendence found in Tolle, and show how Christianity acknowledges and incorporates the core of this idea into a larger narrative that accounts for the ethical treatment of others, the avoidance of spiritual egoism, a graceful way of living that is similar to mindfulness yet more durable and ethical, etc... I think this could be interesting and encouraging.  
  
**Claude**: Thank you, I'm glad we could have a balanced discussion exploring both the parallels and differences between these perspectives. And that's an interesting challenge - to demonstrate how Christianity could incorporate the core insights of ego transcendence like Tolle presents, while grounding them in a richer narrative and theological framework. Here is my attempt at this type of "orthodox yet modern" Christian apologetic for ego transcendence:  
  
The teachings of Eckhart Tolle and others point to an important spiritual truth: there is an deeper dimension of our being that transcends the ego, mind, and limited self-concept. At our core, we are one with the ground of all being - we can awaken to this through surrender, grace, and living in the present moment.   
  
Yet Christianity provides the narrative context for understanding and pursuing ego transcendence in a fuller, more ethical way:  
  
- Dying to self is not an end in itself, but a means to new life in Christ. As we lose our life, we gain it - our old self dies and is resurrected in Christ as a new creation. This prevents ego transcendence from becoming another form of spiritual egoism.   
- Ego transcendence is not achieved through our practice alone, but by grace through faith in Christ. While spiritual disciplines like mindfulness, contemplation and surrender can help quiet the ego, salvation is God's initiative and gift. This prevents ego transcendence from becoming a new form of self-seeking salvation by works.   
- Transcending ego is not the ultimate goal, but allows us to be in deeper relationship with God and neighbor. A non-dualistic unity consciousness must give way to love of personal encounter within the Trinity and with all people. The other remains other, even as we are one in Christ. This prevents ego transcendence from being an end in itself.  
- Living in the Now is a call not to complacency but courage, sacrifice, and transformation. Following Christ's way of humility, service, and compassion is not a path to inner peace but a radical call to discipleship. This aligns living in the present moment with the greater mission of God to redeem all things.   
- Mindfulness of the present moment is a means to recollect ourselves in God's presence, not an end in itself. We quiet the ego's anxieties and desires not to achieve a state of pure being, but to create space for the grace of God to transform us into Christ's likeness, and empower us for acts of love and justice.   
  
In summary, Christianity takes the kernel of truth in ego transcendence - our core union with the divine ground of being - and situates it within the narrative of creation, incarnation, and redemption. The self is transcended not for its own sake, but so we can be made new in Christ for the life of the world. There is a more compelling vision and purpose to awakening beyond limited selfhood. In this way, the wisdom of spiritual traditions can be incorporated and fulfilled in the Gospel.  
  
Does this point in the type of "orthodox yet modern" direction you were suggesting? I'm interested in your feedback on this approach. And of course, many more things could be said - this is just a brief apologetic sketch. Let me know your thoughts!  
  
**Mike**: This is a great start! Some aspects of this are really well done. Some ideas to improve it would be (1) work in the observation that the personal name of God in the Old Testament (YHWH) is associated with "pure being" (like the important idea in Tolle) while also being represented as personal (2) Generally, including a synthesis of the Christian virtues of faith, hope, and love would be helpful (3) specifically, connect the idea of humility with your statements about "Transcending ego is not the ultimate goal, but allows us to be in a deeper relationship with God and neighbor". To this last point, humility seems to be a very strong connecting point to ego transcendence. (4) Includes quotes from the bible where appropriate to strengthen the points you are making. (5) If you're aware of Tim Keller's speaking and writing, it might be a helpful style reference for this essay we are working on.  
  
**Claude**: Thank you, this is very helpful feedback. Here is a revised version that incorporates these suggestions:  
  
The teachings of Eckhart Tolle and others point to an important spiritual truth: there is a deeper dimension of our being, rooted in the eternal I AM, that transcends the ego and limited self-concept. At our core, we are one with the ground of all being; we can awaken to this through surrender, grace, and living in the present moment.  
  
Yet Christianity provides the narrative context for understanding and pursuing ego transcendence in a fuller, more ethical way:  
  
- The divine name YHWH, "I AM", points to God's nature as the ground of being, while the incarnation of Jesus shows God as personal. Dying to self allows new life in Christ, a personal relationship with the God who is being itself.  
- Ego transcendence requires the Christian virtues of faith, hope and love. Faith in Christ, not self-seeking, frees us from ego; hope for the kingdom of God motivates us beyond the present moment; and love leads us to humble service of neighbor, not spiritual egoism.  
- Humility is the centerpoint between transcending ego and loving relationship. As C.S. Lewis wrote, "Humility is not thinking less of yourself; it's thinking of yourself less." By looking not to our own interests but to Christ and others, we can be "made low" then exalted in union with God.  
- Living in the Now is not complacency but courage, sacrifice, and transformation. As Jesus said, "Whoever loses their life for my sake will find it." (Matt. 16:25). Following Christ's way of the cross is dying to self through humility and service, that we may know the power of his resurrection.  
- Mindfulness of the present moment recollects us in God's presence through faith and prayer, not for itself but to "be transformed by the renewing of your mind." (Rom. 12:2). We look to Christ in the Now not for inner peace but to be changed into his likeness through the grace of God.  
- Transcending ego allows deeper relationship and empowerment. "I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.” (Gal. 2:20)  
  
In summary, Christianity takes the kernel of truth in ego transcendence but grounds it in the narrative of creation, incarnation, and redemption. The self is transcended not for its own sake, but so we can be made new in Christ for the life of the world. There is a more compelling vision and purpose to awakening beyond limited selfhood into union and mission. The Gospel fulfills the wisdom of "The Power of Now" and all spiritual traditions.  
  
How's this? I aimed to strengthen the key points with scripture, introduce more synthesis around the virtues, and reflect Tim Keller's style of cultural engagement. Please let me know if this revised approach is helpful - I'm happy to continue refining further! Discussing this has been very thought-provoking for me as well.  
  
**Mike**: Good job at incorporating my suggestions. Now that we have a base essay. there are some areas that I would like to explore deeper. I'm still very interested in ego transcendence and how it may be concomitant with Christian teachings. You quoted Romans 12:2 where Paul says "be transformed by the renewing of your mind.". I'm wondering how the idea of renewing of one's mind might be related to Tolle's ideas related to us being distinct from our mind and using our mind as a tool rather than letting our minds use us. Perhaps you could do some comparison of passages like this so we can see more connection points between these two ways of thinking.  
  
**Claude**: That's a great suggestion, exploring how biblical teachings on spiritual renewal and mind correspond to the idea of transcending ego and the limited, self-centered mind. Here are some key points of connection:  
  
- Tolle argues we are not our mind, but pure being/consciousness, and we can learn to disidentify from the mind and ego. Similarly, Christianity teaches we are not defined by our thoughts, but by our true identity in Christ as children of God. We can be "transformed by the renewing of your mind" as we move from an ego-centric way of thinking to the mind of Christ. (1 Cor. 2:16)  
- The "old self" ruled by the restless, anxious mind gives way to the "new self" ruled by the Spirit. (Eph. 4:22-24) This resembles how Tolle says we can transcend the ego-mind and find our true being. But for Paul, our true self is found in Christ, not a pure impersonal consciousness. Still, there is a similar dynamic of dying to one's old way of thinking and being made anew.   
- Tolle teaches the importance of stilling the ego-mind through mindfulness and living in the present moment. Similarly, Scripture emphasizes stillness, silence, and solitude as ways God renews our mind. "Be still and know that I am God." (Ps. 46:10) In stillness, we can "listen" for God's voice beyond the clamor of our ego-mind. (Ps. 62:1; Zech. 2:13)  
- A "renewed" mind is focused not on anxious thoughts of the false self (ego), but on God and the things of the Spirit. (Rom. 8:5-6; Col. 3:2) This resembles how Tolle says we can realize our true self by looking beyond ego to the ground of being. But the Christian knows true being is found in communion with the personal, triune God - not in a non-dualistic consciousness.   
- Ultimately, the renewed mind sees all things in the light of Christ, and views oneself with the mind of Christ. (1 Cor. 2:16; Phil. 2:5; Rom. 12:2) This is key to humility, discernment and compassion. Similarly, Tolle argues we find wisdom, peace and deeper relationship as we transcend ego-mind. But for Paul, all true knowledge and renewal is "in Christ".   
  
In summary, there are significant parallels between ego transcendence and a Christian spiritual renewal of mind - but they differ in their vision of our ultimate identity and relationship to the divine. Transcending a limited, ego-ruled way of thinking is a step on the path, but our true being and highest knowledge are found in Christ alone. I hope this helps clarify both the connections and differences here. Let me know if you have any other thoughts or questions!  
  
**Mike**: This continues to be really very interesting. Thanks, Claude! It's particularly interesting that you mention the identity of "Children of God" in the context of ego transcendence because a friend of mine said something very similar to me yesterday. I want to take these away from Paul and to the Old Testament now. Lately, I've been very interested in Psalm 37. Generally, the psalm seems to be a reflection on theodicy in one way or another, but the section in Psalm 37:3 - 8 seems to include a very useful framework for acting in the world. "Trust in the Lord and do good", "delight yourself in the Lord", "Commit your way to the Lord", "be still before the Lord and wait", and "fret not yourself" are the ideas I'm thinking about. A framework of Trust, do, delight, commit, wait, and fret not seems powerful for many reasons, but as a way of living seems like it could be connected to the idea of ego transcendence. Perhaps you could expand on this idea (if you agree) and connect it with the wider wisdom tradition of the Old Testament?  
  
**Claude**: That's a great connection to draw. The exhortations in Psalm 37:3-8 do provide a framework for ego transcendence and spiritual renewal of mind. Some key points:  
  
- "Trust in the Lord and do good" - Rather than trusting in our own ego and desires, we surrender to God's will and guidance. This humility and faith enable us to "do good" from a place of selflessness rather than ego.   
- "Delight yourself in the Lord" - We shift our joy and contentment away from gratifying ego to finding our delight in God alone. This helps quiet the restless striving of the ego-mind.   
- "Commit your way to the Lord" - We release control over our lives to God, rather than trying to shape life according to the ego's agenda. This requires relinquishing the ego's insistence on its own way.   
- "Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for him" - Stillness and silence quiet the ego-mind with its anxieties and agendas. Waiting on God's timing requires surrendering our own ego's restlessness, impatience and desire for control.   
- "Fret not yourself" - When we dwell in ego, we are prone to worry, distress, irritation and anger. Transcending ego through trust in God delivers us from this fretful, emotionally tumultuous state. We abide in God's peace.  
- This framework resembles teachings on ego transcendence by encouraging humility, release of control, stillness, patience, and finding contentment in God rather than ego. But again, the end is not a impersonal non-dualism but loving union with the personal, sovereign God of Scripture.   
  
More broadly, the wisdom tradition of the Old Testament points to this in other ways:  
  
- The limits of human knowledge and control, and the need to acknowledge our creaturely finitude before God the Creator. This counters ego's temptation to see itself as the center and source of knowledge, meaning, and power.   
- The character of humility, mercy, and compassion as the true wisdom. Rather than building up ego through power, status, and pride, we find wisdom through serving God and others. (Prov. 3:34; 29:23)  
- The vanity of life "under the sun" when lived for ego's pleasures and gains. True meaning and purpose are found in fearing God and keeping his commands. (Eccl. 12:13-14)   
- The folly of self-righteousness. Scripture shows how God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble. (Prov. 3:34; James 4:6) Righteousness is a gift of grace, not ego's achievement.   
- The wisdom of self-surrender. "Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it." (Matt. 10:39) We transcend ego-life to receive our true life in God.  
  
Overall, the Old Testament wisdom tradition provides a robust vision of how we can transcend ego and find our life in God through humility, trust, silence, and self-surrender. Like in Psalm 37, it guides us in a way of faith and stillness before God rather than fretful ego and self-will. Does this help summarize the connections here? Let me know if you have any other thoughts or questions!  
  
**Mike**: Thanks Claude, this gives me a lot to think about. I'm out of time for now, but I may want to dig into this further at some point in the future.  
  
**Claude**: You're welcome! I've enjoyed our discussion exploring connections between ego transcendence and Christian teachings. These are deep topics, so there is always more to say. Please feel free to ask me to expand on any part of our conversation, or discuss other areas related to this. I'm happy to dialogue further about these kinds of theological and philosophical questions.
