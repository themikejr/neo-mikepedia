# Oxia and Tonos  
As seen in [this discussion on B-Greek](https://www.ibiblio.org/bgreek/forum/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=4170), There are visual overlaps between the polytonic (oxia) and monotonic (tonos) unicode characters for the acute accent. This [wiki article](https://wiki.digitalclassicist.org/Greek_Unicode_duplicated_vowels) gives a helpful explanation. My summary:  
  
- Oxia comes from the [Greek Extended](http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1F00.pdf)  unicode block.  
- The polytonic / oxia normalized to monotonic / tonos.  
- In 2016 oxia was formally deprecated.  
  
James Tauber also has an explanation [here](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9783110599572-009/html?lang=en).
