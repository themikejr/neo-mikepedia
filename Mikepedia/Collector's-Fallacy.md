# The Collector's Fallacy  
Obtaining is not knowing. **The Collector's Fallacy** says *if I could just become aware of an idea*, or *if I could just obtain information about this thing* then I will be well on my way to expanding and developing my knowledge. Our web browsing and social media habits get looped into our dopamine circuits so that we are forever caught in the collecting mindset. We convince ourselves that collecting makes us smarter but the at best, we are only creating an opportunity for ourselves to learn in the future.  
  
Knowing requires the [integration](../Subsidiary%20Focal%20Integration.md) of that which we observe. Expanding and developing knowledge requires a change in ourselves.   
  
**The Collector's Fallacy** runs rampant in [Personal Knowledge Management](./Personal-Knowledge-Management.md) and **Productivity** circles. We can also get stuck wanting to know all there is to know about a subject before kicking of a project. Collecting and analyzing becomes a procrastination crutch. It's also connected to deeper problems with our base assumptions about knowing in the west. See [The Defective Epistemic Default](../The%20Defective%20Epistemic%20Default.md).

> ‘to know about something’ isn’t the same as ‘knowing something’. Just _knowing about_ a thing is less than superficial since knowing about is merely to be certain of its existence, nothing more. Ultimately, this fake-knowledge is hindering us on our road to true excellence. Until we merge the _contents,_ the information, ideas, and thoughts of other people into our own knowledge, we haven’t really learned a thing. We don’t change ourselves if we don’t learn, so merely filing things away doesn’t lead us anywhere.
