# The Collector's Fallacy  
Obtaining is not knowing. **The Collector's Fallacy** says *if I could just become aware of an idea*, or *if I could just obtain information about this thing* then I will be well on my way to expanding and developing my knowledge. Our web browsing and social media habits get looped into our dopamine circuits so that we are ever caught in pursuing the collection information. We convince ourselves that these acts are developing knowledge but at best we are only material that could be used to develop knowledge.   
  
Knowing requires the [integration](../Subsidiary%20Focal%20Integration.md) of that which we observe. Expanding and developing knowledge requires a change in ourselves.   
  
**The Collector's Fallacy** runs rampant in [Personal Knowledge Management](./Personal-Knowledge-Management.md) and **Productivity** circles. We also get stuck on our projects when we wish to know before we start (by collecting information). It's also connected to deeper problems with our base assumptions about knowing in the west. See [The Defective Epistemic Default](../The%20Defective%20Epistemic%20Default.md).

> ‘to know about something’ isn’t the same as ‘knowing something’. Just _knowing about_ a thing is less than superficial since knowing about is merely to be certain of its existence, nothing more. Ultimately, this fake-knowledge is hindering us on our road to true excellence. Until we merge the _contents,_ the information, ideas, and thoughts of other people into our own knowledge, we haven’t really learned a thing. We don’t change ourselves if we don’t learn, so merely filing things away doesn’t lead us anywhere.
